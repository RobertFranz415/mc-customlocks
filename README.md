# CustomLocksMC

## Summary

A highly customizable and easy to use lock/lockpick plugin for minecraft servers. 

Add a lock to any block with a blockstate with a click of the mouse. This consits of chests, dispensers, enchanting tables, and more.  The full list of what can be lockedf can be found [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/block/BlockState.html).

The lockpicks are persistent through server restarts without files needed to save them.

Adding and customizing a lock can be done in game by simply using the '/customlockpick' command to open the menu containing an admin key.  Then the player just needs to click on the block with the admin key in hand and the customization menu will open.

There are four different lockpick minigames to choose from.  The user can add any combination of minigames to the block to be randomly selected when a player attempts to lockpick.

The customization menu also allows for the user to edit the difficulty of the lock.  Specific values of the difficulties themselves can be customized by the user using yaml files.

Other settings included such as: an auto lock which will automatically lock the chest after a certain amount of time after it was initially opened, and lockability which allows locks to be re-locked using a key.
